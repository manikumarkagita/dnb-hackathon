The scope of this problem statement is to find ways to use 5G technology to improve 
connectivity in rural areas, which typically have poor or non-existent internet access. 
The background of this problem is that while 5G technology has the potential to bring 
faster and more reliable internet access to remote areas, there are still many challenges 
to overcome in terms of infrastructure and cost.
