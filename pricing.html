          The shipyard area is where TEU containers are stored, for both imports
          and exports. Due to the dynamic container load change during
          loading/unloading, the height of containers can stack from nil to
          several (eg. 5 containers with each 2.6m). The metallic nature of TEU
          containers can severely affect RF propagation especially if antenna
          towers are inland and serving is required at the far end of vessel
          berth. Investigation/analysis is suggested to determine the optimal
          base station placement and planning to ensure 5G coverage is available
          for all use cases.
